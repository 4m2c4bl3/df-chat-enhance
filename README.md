![Latest Release Download Count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/4m2c4bl3/save-message-to-journal-entry/latest/module.zip)

An incredibly basic recreation of [DF Chat Enhancements](https://github.com/flamewave000/dragonflagon-fvtt/blob/master/df-chat-enhance/README.md#Adventure-Log)'s Adventure Log feature.

* Each player can set a Journal to use for their saved messages
* Messages will be saved in an existing page if chosen, or a pre-named page (Noted Messages) is created
* Using the right-click context menu in the Chat Messages tab, you can select 'Write Message to Journal'
* Newly written messages are at the top of the journal page, with older ones down at the bottom
* Timestamps are adjusted to be permanent rather than relative, and some message management is stripped out, but other than that the messages are left unedited
* Selection is based off name, so changing names will require the Journal/page to be reselected in the settings

I do not have the time or ability to maintain this tool beyond what is needed for my game sessions, requests for features can be opened but will rely on another dev coming in and improving it out of the kindness of their heart. :o)
