An incredibly basic recreation of [DF Chat Enhancements](https://github.com/flamewave000/dragonflagon-fvtt/blob/master/df-chat-enhance/README.md#Adventure-Log)'s Adventure Log feature. Copy a message from chat into a page in a journal. System agnostic.

_I do not have the time to maintain or improve this tool past making it run for my own table. I do have time to review pull requests though! :o)_

**Using the right-click context menu in the Chat Messages tab, any user can chose to 'Write Message to Journal'.** This adds a copy of the chat message into the journal
* Before using this feature, each user must first select a target journal in Game Settings
* Messages can be saved in an existing page, or a pre-named page (Noted Messages) will be created
* Messages are placed at the top of whatever is already existing in the page, and should be non-destructive
* Journal/page selection is based off name, so changing names will require users to update their choices in Game Settings
* Timestamps are adjusted to be permanent rather than relative, and some message management (delete button etc) is stripped out
* Manually editing a page with saved message can and will destroy styling/formatting
* Buttons and any other advanced features in messages will/should not work in the journal page
* Easily split noted messages into their own entries if you use the module [Split Join Journal](https://github.com/toastygm/split-join-journal)!
